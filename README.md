# cuedSGT

EPrime script for a replication of Cued Self-Generated Thought, originally published by Spreng and Grady (J Cogn. Neurosci. 22, 1112-1123, 2010). The present script is detailed in a Scientific Data manuscript, currently under review. 

Briefly, participants were presented with the three experimental conditions detailed in Spreng and Grady (2010), a sensorimotor control condition, and a novel second control condition. In the three experimental conditions, IAPS images were presented and followed by condition-specific cued self-generated thought prompts (e.g., "Imagine what the women in the photograph were thinking and feeling.") Participants were instructed to rate the clarity of their visualization on a scale of 1-3. In the sensorimotor control condition, participants were presented with a scrambled image followed by a button press instruction. In the novel second control condition, participants were presented with an IAPS image immediately followed by a fixation. In all conditions, each image was presented with an associated cue word (e.g., with a picture of a classroom, the cue word "Learning" would be presented.)

The provided EPrime script allows for additional data collection with this protocol. Please note that we are not able to provide the associated stimuli, as these require a prior agreement with the Center for the Study of Emotion and Attention at the University of Florida (http://csea.phhp.ufl.edu/media.html).
